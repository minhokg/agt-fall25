    "# Problem Set 2: Two-player Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma\n",
    "Minho Kang (239742)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this problem set, I will simulate a two-player Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game using several strategies. The objective of this assignment is to explore how different strategies interact in the context of the prisoner's dilemma, focusing on payoffs, cooperation, and defection patterns. We will test the following strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tit-for-Tat\n",
    "2. Grim Trigger\n",
    "3. Always Cooperate\n",
    "4. Always Defect\n",
    "5. Probabilistic Strategy\n",
    "6. Intermediate Punishment Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Payoff Matrix\n",
    "The payoff matrix used for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "|               | **Cooperate** | **Defect** |\n",
    "|---------------|---------------|------------|\n",
    "| **Cooperate** | 6, 6          | 2, 10      |\n",
    "| **Defect**    | 10, 2         | 4, 4       |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The primary objective of this problem set is to implement and simulate a series of strategies in an iterated version of the Prisoner's Dilemma game and analyze their payoffs and behavior when played against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "### Strategies Implemented\n",
    "1. **Tit-for-Tat**: This strategy cooperates on the first move and then mimics the opponent's previous move.\n",
    "2. **Grim Trigger**: This strategy cooperates until the opponent defects, after which it defects permanently.\n",
    "3. **Always Cooperate**: This strategy always cooperates regardless of the opponent's moves.\n",
    "4. **Always Defect**: This strategy always defects regardless of the opponent's moves.\n",
    "5. **Probabilistic Strategy**: This strategy cooperates with a given probability `p` and defects with the complementary probability.\n",
    "6. **Intermediate Punishment**: This strategy cooperates until the opponent defects. If the opponent defects, it will not cooperate for the next `k` rounds but will return to cooperation afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Setup\n",
    "The game was simulated over a series of 10 rounds, where each strategy played against every other strategy, except against itself. For each game, the cumulative payoffs were calculated, and the moves of the players were recorded for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of rounds was chosen to be 10 to balance between observing long-term effects and avoiding excessive computation time. Additionally, the `k` parameter in the Intermediate Punishment strategy was set to 3.\n",
    "And \"gamma\" (discount factor) was set to 0.9.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the keynotes for the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For **Grim Trigger**, **Tit-for-Tat**, and **Intermediate Punishment**, when these strategies play against each other, the cooperation rates are always 100%. This indicates that these strategies are well-suited for cooperation when paired with each other.\n",
    "2. **\"Always Defect\" against \"Always Cooperate\"** results in the highest total payoff for Player 2. This is because **\"Always Defect\"** exploits the cooperative nature of **\"Always Cooperate\"** and consistently maximizes Player 2's payoff while minimizing Player 1's payoff.\n",
    "3. **\"Always Cooperate\"** maintains a high cooperation rate (1.00 for both players) and results in the best cooperation behavior when playing against cooperative strategies like **Tit-for-Tat**, **Grim Trigger**, and **Intermediate Punishment**.\n",
    "4. **\"Tit-for-Tat\"** and **\"Grim Trigger\"** also achieve high cooperation rates against **\"Always Cooperate\"** and other cooperative strategies. However, **Tit-for-Tat** is more forgiving than **Grim Trigger**, as **Grim Trigger** will defect permanently after a single defection, while **Tit-for-Tat** will only defect once the opponent defects and then revert back to cooperation.\n",
    "5. **\"Probabilistic (p=0.5)\"** shows mixed cooperation rates. It cooperates around 50% of the time, but depending on its opponent, the cooperation rate can vary (e.g., it cooperates less with **\"Always Defect\"** and more with cooperative strategies).\n",
    "6. The **Intermediate Punishment Strategy** is an interesting case, as it balances cooperation and punishment. It returns to cooperation after **k** rounds of defection when the opponent defects. It works well in maintaining cooperation with cooperative strategies and has a high cooperation rate when playing against strategies like **Tit-for-Tat** and **Always Cooperate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Insights:\n",
    "- **Cooperation is sustainable** when both players are willing to reciprocate cooperation (like in **Tit-for-Tat**, **Grim Trigger**, and **Intermediate Punishment**).\n",
    "- **Defection** is a dominant strategy for **Always Defect**, but it often results in a lower overall payoff, especially when paired against cooperative strategies.\n",
    "- **Tit-for-Tat** is one of the most balanced strategies, performing well against both cooperative and defecting opponents.\n",
    "- **Intermediate Punishment** can serve as a middle ground, punishing defections temporarily and returning to cooperation, ensuring a good balance between cooperation and defense against exploitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis reveals that cooperative strategies like **Tit-for-Tat** and **Grim Trigger** are highly effective in sustaining cooperation, while **Always Defect** is successful in exploiting **Always Cooperate**. The **Intermediate Punishment Strategy** offers a way to sustain cooperation while adding a corrective measure for defection.\n",
